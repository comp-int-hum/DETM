# Dynamic Topic Modeling Library

This repository is derived from [the Blei lab's DETM code base](https://github.com/adjidieng/DETM) to serve as a centralized, pip-installable workspace for our use and development of this model-family in the computational humanities.  Everything up to the point of our initial fork should be attributed to:
